      <title>Sensing the real world through NHS prescriptions data</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/nhs_prescriptions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers and practitioners intererested in geography of health, social dynamics, economics, and everything in between are always interested methods that use data to sense health outcomes in the real world. If one can create proxies for health, and map them on to geographical units, one could ask important questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) How does health of an area relate with its socio-economic conditions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Are there any temporal trends or periodicities in certain health outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) What is the relationship between health indicators from the real world and the signals obtained from online data source like social media (e.g. as seen in this paper: &lt;a href=&#34;http://social-dynamics.net/docs/icwsm-21.pdf&#34;&gt;http://social-dynamics.net/docs/icwsm-21.pdf&lt;/a&gt; )?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) Do certain policy or demograhic factors make an area more suseptible to particular health conditions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order to be creative with such questions, one needs a principled way to create proxies for health outcomes from official datasources, at scale, and map them onto geographical units. Unfortunately, most health data sources are highly protected, if not propreitary, and the processing steps required to translate raw data into geographical outcomes are tedious and often require domain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 2 years at Bell Labs, I have been working on something that would partly solve these issues. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sagarjoglekar/NHSPrescriptionsParser&#34;&gt;NHS Prescriptions parser&lt;/a&gt; allows practitioners to mine the openly available NHS prescriptions data to make geo-spatial estimates about health outcomes across England. A more detailed manual about the steps for usage can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@SagarJoglekar/mapping-health-outcomes-at-the-scale-of-an-entire-nation-bbe0eb949eea&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cost of being on the fence.</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/expedia/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 12:14:56 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/expedia/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 2.5 years of association with Nokia Bell Labs, I have decided to move on to do something else. I will be moving into a more product oriented data science role at the Expedia Group, from a blue sky research role at Bell labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*x612akvUDJflKu7ym_ugEg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;The legacy of Bell Labs&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with such a stellar organization and its brilliant people was truly enriching in so many ways. But it was equally an excercise in self awareness. And the greatest outcome of this excercise, to me, was the awareness of the costs of being on the fence. Let me explain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while  ago — in the middle of one of the many pandemic-driven-existential-crisis — I doodled something that I thought captures a principle about how I should spend the limited time I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sagarjoglekar.com/img/Curiosity_impact.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;doodle&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis roughly states that one has limited time to spend on this earth on things other than living, and they should optimize it to maximize &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and maximize &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;curiosity driven learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But a corollary of this principle is that it is extremly hard, if not impossible, to maximize both at the same time, without sacrificing other facets of life. In other words, maximizing both requires walking up the line at 45 degrees (which I call the fence) to the very top right corner. However, more often than not, you end up loitering around the central part of this fence. This is because , in my experience, maximizing either often require orthogonal sets of skills. To drive impact one needs focus of execution, and a relentless will to iterate over the build -&amp;gt; test -&amp;gt; deliver -&amp;gt; repeat cycles. To leverage curiosity, one needs an open mind and enough time to try things out. Being on the fence means you cannot do either well. This means you are not going to produce impact as measured by ROI, or number of lives affected; or produce truly deep knowledge that comes form digging deep where your curiosity leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always considered myself to be a curious person, with a wide spectrum of interests. Putting myself into a box was never an intriguing idea, which is precisely why I always wanted to do a Ph.D. A doctoral journey, in my honest opinion, has more to do with the framework of thought, than with the resulting outcomes. It teaches you to start off from zero and dig deep enough to discover new knowledge, and you may do this several times in a typical Ph.D tenure. This process is immensely valuable for generalist and specialists alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, I have also always immensly valued impact, and the gratification felt while witnessing what you have built being used by real people. This tug of war between the two orthogonal phylosophies meant that I involuntarily defaulted to the fence when thinking about projects and time commitments. Choosing to sit on the fence is deliberately choosing a sub-optimal environment, thereby limiting your opportunities to thrive. So for now, I will be playing the jump rope with the fence, and see where that leads me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Press cover for our WWW 2020 paper: Stop Tracking Me Bro! Differential Tracking Of User Demographics On Hyper-partisan Websites</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/trackingpresscover/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:14:56 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/trackingpresscover/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Super excited to see that our paper on measuring differential behaviour of ad-tracking ecosystem towards the consumers of hyper-partisan websites was covered by the Wired news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we simulated behaviours of users belonging to particular partisan and demographic classes, and observed how the online advertisement machinenary tracks them as they visit well known partisan news websites. To our surprise, we found that the very nature of such automated profiling systems pushes them to preferentially track users with specific partisan lean more. This also reflects in the difference in the tracking behaviour of right leaning users visiting right leaning news websites versus left leaning news websites. We open source the framework and the data, to further the understanding around how our partisan attitudes shape the advertisement ecosystem on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper conjectures that the partisan nature of today&#39;s news ecosystem might actually seep into the tracking machinery; over time learning the likes and dislikes along partisan lines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Press cover for Facelift</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/facelift/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 12:14:56 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/facelift/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce the publication of &amp;ldquo;FaceLift: a transparent deep learning framework to beautify urban scenes&amp;rdquo; in the Royal soceity open science journal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facelift is a Deeplearning driven algorithm, that goes beyond assessing beauty in urban scenes (streetviews) &amp;ndash; as done by other studies in the field &amp;ndash; and recreates the elements that can make any given urban scene more beautiful. It then explains away the elements behind the beauty using metrics which are commonly understood by the target users of this system such as Urban Planners and Architects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study builds a model of urban beauty(X) using 20,000 street view images, and around 1 million votes from the crowds about the beauty of any given streetview. It then uses Generative Adversarial models, to mutate an input image into something that maximizes its beauty score for the model X.
The differences between the input and the output urban scenes are then explained using computer vision algorithms in terms of 5 urban design metric viz. Walkability, Greenery, Complexity, Openness and Landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this system is the first step towards augmenting the urban planning industry using AI, and that too at the scale of an entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article has got some press attention too. Please find some coverages below :&lt;/p&gt;

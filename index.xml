      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 21st century would witness one of the largest urban migration in human history. A lot of research has gone into understanding the effects of the urban life on physical and mental health. The results have been unanimous: The urban environment has long lasting impacts on our well being. The facets of our urban environment that impact on our health and well being are called the urban exposome.
In these projects, I attempt to quantify this exposome using techiques from deep learning, complex network, GIS, and NLP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These works have got some press attention. Please find some coverages below:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We as a soceity have accepted the internet as an extension of the self. The online disinhibition effect sometimes allows us to open up to strangers in order to seek support, or disclose proxies for medical conditions in the process of being social on the networking platforms. In these works, I explored different models in order to capture these concepts, using methods from complex networks and NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measuring the partisan web and its effects</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/project/hyperpartisannews/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet has made seamless access to information channels, a reality. As a result, a lot of issues of the offline world, are now being voiced, shared, and discussed on the internet; including but not limited to partisan and hot button issues. As a result, phenomenona like fake news and polarising partisan news have become a central theme for inter-disciplinary research. These works investigate the hyper-partisan ecosystem and other social media processes that may have profound effects on how democracy functions in our post internet world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some press coverage for this work can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a churn of new platforms exploring new ways to network people, and their content. From primacy driven social media platforms like Tik-tok, Vine and Instagram, to a more decentralized socially curated content platform like Mastodom. These works explore models, methods, and pipelines to measure how humans adopt and interact with these new and innovative platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cost of being on the fence.</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/expedia/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 12:14:56 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/expedia/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 2.5 years of association with Nokia Bell Labs, I have decided to move on to do something else. I will be moving into a more product oriented data science role at the Expedia Group, from a blue sky research role at Bell labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*x612akvUDJflKu7ym_ugEg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;The legacy of Bell Labs&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with such a stellar organization and its brilliant people was truly enriching in so many ways. But it was equally an excercise in self awareness. And the greatest outcome of this excercise, to me, was the awareness of the costs of being on the fence. Let me explain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while  ago — in the middle of one of the many pandemic-driven-existential-crisis — I doodled something that I thought captures a principle about how I should spend the limited time I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sagarjoglekar.com/img/Curiosity_impact.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;doodle&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis roughly states that one has limited time to spend on this earth on things other than living, and they should optimize it to maximize &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and maximize &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;curiosity driven learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But a corollary of this principle is that it is extremly hard, if not impossible, to maximize both at the same time, without sacrificing other facets of life. In other words, maximizing both requires walking up the line at 45 degrees (which I call the fence) to the very top right corner. However, more often than not, you end up loitering around the central part of this fence. This is because , in my experience, maximizing either often require orthogonal sets of skills. To drive impact one needs focus of execution, and a relentless will to iterate over the build -&amp;gt; test -&amp;gt; deliver -&amp;gt; repeat cycles. To leverage curiosity, one needs an open mind and enough time to try things out. Being on the fence means you cannot do either well. This means you are not going to produce impact as measured by ROI, or number of lives affected; or produce truly deep knowledge that comes form digging deep where your curiosity leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always considered myself to be a curious person, with a wide spectrum of interests. Putting myself into a box was never an intriguing idea, which is precisely why I always wanted to do a Ph.D. A doctoral journey, in my honest opinion, has more to do with the framework of thought, than with the resulting outcomes. It teaches you to start off from zero and dig deep enough to discover new knowledge, and you may do this several times in a typical Ph.D tenure. This process is immensely valuable for generalist and specialists alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, I have also always immensly valued impact, and the gratification associated with witnessing what you have built being used in the wild. This meant that I tended to default to sitting on the fence while thinking about projects and time budgets. And choosing to sit on the fence, is choosing to be in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru&#34;&gt;Kobayashi Maru&lt;/a&gt; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has made me re-evaluate whether I have what it takes to be in academia. And certainly the answer is no. But that does not mean I do not have what it takes to be a researcher. So for now, I will be playing the jump rope with the fence, and see where that leads me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Press cover for our WWW 2020 paper: Stop Tracking Me Bro! Differential Tracking Of User Demographics On Hyper-partisan Websites</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/trackingpresscover/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:14:56 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Super excited to see that our paper on measuring differential behaviour of ad-tracking ecosystem towards the consumers of hyper-partisan websites was covered by the Wired news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we simulated behaviours of users belonging to particular partisan and demographic classes, and observed how the online advertisement machinenary tracks them as they visit well known partisan news websites. To our surprise, we found that the very nature of such automated profiling systems pushes them to preferentially track users with specific partisan lean more. This also reflects in the difference in the tracking behaviour of right leaning users visiting right leaning news websites versus left leaning news websites. We open source the framework and the data, to further the understanding around how our partisan attitudes shape the advertisement ecosystem on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper conjectures that the partisan nature of today&#39;s news ecosystem might actually seep into the tracking machinery; over time learning the likes and dislikes along partisan lines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Press cover for Facelift</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/facelift/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 12:14:56 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sagarjoglekar.com/post/facelift/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce the publication of &amp;ldquo;FaceLift: a transparent deep learning framework to beautify urban scenes&amp;rdquo; in the Royal soceity open science journal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facelift is a Deeplearning driven algorithm, that goes beyond assessing beauty in urban scenes (streetviews) &amp;ndash; as done by other studies in the field &amp;ndash; and recreates the elements that can make any given urban scene more beautiful. It then explains away the elements behind the beauty using metrics which are commonly understood by the target users of this system such as Urban Planners and Architects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study builds a model of urban beauty(X) using 20,000 street view images, and around 1 million votes from the crowds about the beauty of any given streetview. It then uses Generative Adversarial models, to mutate an input image into something that maximizes its beauty score for the model X.
The differences between the input and the output urban scenes are then explained using computer vision algorithms in terms of 5 urban design metric viz. Walkability, Greenery, Complexity, Openness and Landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this system is the first step towards augmenting the urban planning industry using AI, and that too at the scale of an entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article has got some press attention too. Please find some coverages below :&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Social networks and health</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We as a society have accepted the internet as an extension of the self. The online disinhibition effect sometimes allows us to open up to strangers in order to seek support, or disclose proxies for medical conditions while being social on the networking platforms. These signals &amp;ndash; albeit subtle &amp;ndash; could be used to develop tools to understand population health, and in some cases, develop interventions. In these works, I explored different data source, methods, and models to capture these signals using methods from complex networks and NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human behaviour on networked systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Networked systems went through several phases over the past 40 years. In the first phase the network was a vessel for movement of data. The second processed and stored that data in order to allow users access to services that provide unique value like music, entertainment, and e-commerce, and the third was primaily powered by large companies that added social layers to these troves of services thereby allowing effective curation and recommendation of products and ads. We are now in a phase of an imperfect symbiosis between the real world and it&#39;s virtual projection, allowing offline phenomenons (good and bad) to leak onto the online world and vice versa. In these projects I attempt to measure, model, and design systems that understand and quantify human behaviour in this fourth phase of networked systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quantifying the Urban Exposome</title>
      <link>https://sagarjoglekar.com/project/theurbanexposome/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 21st century would witness one of the largest urban migration in human history. A lot of research has gone into understanding the effects of the urban life on physical and mental health. The results have been unanimous: The urban environment has long lasting impacts on our well being. The facets of our urban environment that impact on our health and well being are called the urban exposome.
In these projects, I attempt to quantify this exposome using techiques from deep learning, complex network, GIS, and NLP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These works have got some press attention. Please find some coverages below:&lt;/p&gt;

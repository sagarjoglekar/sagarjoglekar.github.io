            <p>
                Micro-videos are a new and popular form of social media, which is used by the so called "mellenial" generation to express themselves.
                Our aim in this project is to understand user engagement with these micro-videos.
                The aim of the below survey is to verify the computationally acquired insights that we have with ground truth user data.

                We would appreciate if you could take a few minutes for this survey and contribute to the user study.
                <b> This survey is purely for research purpose. No information gathered from this survey would be used for commercial purposes in any form.
                The outcome of this survey would be published as a part of a scientific publication, which would be displayed on this page post publication </b>.

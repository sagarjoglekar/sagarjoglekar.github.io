To date, however, the correspondence between tie strength and population‚Äôs economic prospects has not been quantified, largely because of the inability to operationalise strength based on Granovetter‚Äôs classic theory. Our work departed from the premise that tie strength is a unidimensional construct (typically operationalized with frequency or volume of contact), and used instead a validated model of ten fundamental dimensions of social relationships grounded in the literature of social psychology. We built state-of-the-art NLP tools to infer the presence of these dimensions from textual communication, and analyzed a large conversation network of 630K geo-referenced Reddit users across the entire US connected by 12.8M social ties created over the span of 7 years. We found that unidimensional tie strength is only weakly correlated with economic opportunities (ùëÖ2=0.30), while multidimensional constructs are highly correlated (ùëÖ2=0.62). In particular, economic opportunities are associated to the combination of: (i) knowledge ties, which bridge geographically distant groups, facilitating the knowledge dissemination across communities; and (ii) social support ties, which knit geographically close communities together, and represent dependable sources of social and emotional support. These results point to the importance of developing high-quality measures of tie strength in network theory.","tags":["Complex Networks","Machine Learning","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Multidimensional tie strength and economic development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ke Zhou","Marios Constantinides","**Sagar Joglekar**","Daniele Quercia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645097378,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648910080,"objectID":"b47c4e003b25a4c22174fb0b3037d079","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/percomp2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-17T12:29:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/percomp2022/","section":"publication","summary":"While current meeting tools are able to capture key analytics (e.g., transcript and summarization), they do not often capture nuanced emotions (e.g., disappointment and feeling impressed).

However, debates on such forums can sometimes escalate into full blown exchanges of hate or misinformation.

This so called polarity prediction task is difficult because replies may be based on external context beyond a post and the reply whose polarity is being predicted. We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walk techniques to capture the wider context of a discussion thread in a principled fashion. Specifically, we propose methods to perform root-seeking graph walks that start from a post and captures its surrounding context to generate additional embeddings for the post. We then use these embeddings to predict the polarity relation between a reply and the post it is replying to. We evaluate the performance of our models on a curated debate dataset from Kialo, an online debating platform.

The question of why individuals engage in physical activity has been widely researched, but that research has predominantly focused on socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, economic status) and coarse-grained spatial characteristics (e.g., population density), overlooking key urban characteristics of, say, whether a city is navigable or, as urban theorist Kevin Lynch put it, whether it is ‚Äòimageable‚Äô (whether its spatial configuration is economic of mental effort). That is mainly because, at scale, it is neither easy to model imageability nor feasible to measure physical activity. We modeled urban imageability with a single scalable metric of entropy, and then measured physical activity from 233K wearable devices over three years, and did so across 19 major cities in the developed world. We found that, after controlling for greenery, wealth, walkability, presence of landmarks, and weather conditions, the legibility hypothesis still holds: the more imageable a city, the more its dwellers engage in physical activity. Interestingly, wealth (GDP per capita) has a positive association with physical activity only in cities with inclement climate, effectively acting as a compensation mechanism for bad weather.","tags":["Deep learning","Data Visualization","Urban Informatics"],"title":"Imagine a Walkable City: Physical activity and urban imageability across 19 major cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ke Zhou","Marios Constantinides","Luca Maria Aiello","**Sagar Joglekar**","Daniele Quercia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636975778,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648910080,"objectID":"13649222ac9ebbdf65e44b1a15d9a885","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/percomp2021_meetings/","publishdate":"2021-11-15T12:29:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/percomp2021_meetings/","section":"publication","summary":"While current meeting tools are able to capture key analytics from both text and voice (e.g., meeting summarization), they do not often capture important types of conversations (e.g., a heated discussion resulting in a conflict being resolved).

Outrage as an emotion played an extremely important role in a tribal society against non-compliant actors. If you got outraged on someone if they betrayed your trust or hoodwinked you, it can quickly translate into a tribal crisis resulting into direct disciplinary consequence, and in most cases depleating the perpetrator of their social capital. On the other hand, a fake/pointless expression of outrage can just as quickly deplete you off social capital and trust. So the action of expression of outrage had direct consequences in a more closed and connected society. Technology has broadened the boundries of this construct, and now , in theory, your social capital is extended beyond the society into the online social networks. However, the consequences of your actions don't equally extend, and in some cases may invert in effect. For example, a controversial and false rumour in a tribal society would immediately deplete you off your social capital, quickly turning you into an outcast. On the other hand, a controversial rumour may act as a click bait due to the recommendation systems that power online social networks, and in-turn provide you with an ever increasing audience. Which means you might be in a way rewarded for your (mis)behaviour.\nNow extend this analogy into the metaverse. Until now, the discretions of malicious actors were limited to controversial or untrue discourse and/or mis-information dissemination. The metaverse would empower these actors to create their own realities, living and sharing it with vulnerable audiences.

According to Philip Strong, the founder of the sociological study of epidemic infectious diseases, not only is an epidemic biological; there is also the potential for three psycho-social epidemics: of fear, moralization, and action. This work empirically tests Strong‚Äôs model at scale by studying the use of language of 122M tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted in the U.S. during the whole year of 2020. On Twitter, we identified three distinct phases. Each of them is characterized by different regimes of the three psycho-social epidemics. In the refusal phase, users refused to accept reality despite the increasing number of deaths in other countries. In the anger phase (started after the announcement of the first death in the country), users‚Äô fear translated into anger about the looming feeling that things were about to change. Finally, in the acceptance phase, which began after the authorities imposed physical-distancing measures, users settled into a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù for their daily activities. Overall, refusal of accepting reality gradually died off as the year went on, while acceptance increasingly took hold. During 2020, as cases surged in waves, so did anger, re-emerging cyclically at each wave. Our real-time operationalization of Strong‚Äôs model is designed in a way that makes it possible to embed epidemic psychology into real-time models (e.g., epidemiological and mobility models).","tags":["Deep learning","Data Visualization","Urban Informatics"],"title":"How epidemic psychology works on Twitter: evolution of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"After 2.5 years of association with Nokia Bell Labs, I have decided to move on to do something else.

But it was equally an excercise in self awareness. And the greatest outcome of this excercise, to me, was the awareness of the costs of being on the fence. Let me explain\nA while ago ‚Äî in the middle of one of the many pandemic-driven-existential-crisis ‚Äî I doodled something that I thought captures a principle about how I should spend the limited time I have.\nThe thesis roughly states that one has limited time to spend on this earth on things other than living, and they should optimize it to maximize impact and maximize curiosity driven learning. But a corollary of this principle is that it is extremly hard, if not impossible, to maximize both at the same time, without sacrificing other facets of life. In other words, maximizing both requires walking up the line at 45 degrees (which I call the fence) to the very top right corner. However, more often than not, you end up loitering around the central part of this fence. This is because , in my experience, maximizing either often require orthogonal sets of skills. To drive impact one needs focus of execution, and a relentless will to iterate over the build -\u0026gt; test -\u0026gt; deliver -\u0026gt; repeat cycles. To leverage curiosity, one needs an open mind and enough time to try things out. Being on the fence means you cannot do either well. This means you are not going to produce impact as measured by ROI, or number of lives affected; or produce truly deep knowledge that comes form digging deep where your curiosity leads.\nI always considered myself to be a curious person, with a wide spectrum of interests. Putting myself into a box was never an intriguing idea, which is precisely why I always wanted to do a Ph.D. A doctoral journey, in my honest opinion, has more to do with the framework of thought, than with the resulting outcomes. It teaches you to start off from zero and dig deep enough to discover new knowledge, and you may do this several times in a typical Ph.D tenure. This process is immensely valuable for generalist and specialists alike.\nBut on the other hand, I have also always immensly valued impact, and the gratification felt while witnessing what you have built being used by real people. This tug of war between the two orthogonal phylosophies meant that I involuntarily defaulted to the fence when thinking about projects and time commitments. Choosing to sit on the fence is deliberately choosing a sub-optimal environment, thereby limiting your opportunities to thrive.

With that tool at hand, we processed Reddit and Twitter posts, analyzed the clusters of the two resulting co-occurrence networks of conditions, and discovered that they correspond to well-defined categories of medical conditions. This resulted in the creation of the first comprehensive taxonomy of medical conditions automatically derived from online discussions.

Back in the 1970s, Jane Jacobs theorized urban vitality and found that there are four conditions required for the promotion of life in cities: diversity of land use, small block sizes, the mix of economic activities, and concentration of people. To build proxies for those four conditions and ultimately test Jane Jacobs's theory at scale, researchers have had to collect both private and public data from a variety of sources, and that took decades. Here we propose the use of one single source of data, which happens to be publicly available: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In particular, since the first two conditions (diversity of land use and small block sizes) are visible to the naked eye from satellite imagery, we tested whether we could automatically extract them with a state-of-the-art deep-learning framework and whether, in the end, the extracted features could predict vitality. In six Italian cities for which we had call data records, we found that our framework is able to explain on average 55% of the variance in urban vitality extracted from those records.","tags":["Deep learning","Data Visualization","Urban Informatics"],"title":"Jane Jacobs in the Sky: Predicting Urban Vitality with Open Satellite Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jun-Ho Choi","Marios Constantinides","**Sagar Joglekar**","Daniele Quercia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613388578,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621114925,"objectID":"11354d7a39b2c658725b85c2e9bba91f","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/hotmobile21/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T12:29:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hotmobile21/","section":"publication","summary":"Successful meetings create a safe environment for contribution; one that attendees feel engaged in and part of. Previous research has shown that meetings success depends not only on execution, but also on whether attendees feel psychologically safe. While this aspect is, to a great extent, partly observable through certain body cues during in-person meetings, they are often overlooked in virtual ones. To partly fix that, we developed Kairos-a system for multi-modal monitoring of virtual meetings that captures subtle body cues. We deployed it in 55 real-world corporate meetings and, upon six metrics for body cues, we built a model to predict a meeting's self-reported success, achieving an AUC as high as 79%. We found that certain body cues were more predictive of a meeting's success (defined as a linear combination of execution and psychological safety) than others (head movements, for example, were twice as predictive as hand movements), not least because they captured three typical meeting phases (its initiation, collective discussions, and turning points) whose presence (or absence) greatly mattered for success.","tags":["Behaviour modelling","Body language","Future of work"],"title":"KAIROS: Talking Heads and Moving Bodies for Successful Meetings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Young, A.P.","**Sagar Joglekar**","Boschi, G.","Sastry, N."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603798178,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608133387,"objectID":"e00b2634c02c002936224bd7c4a58437","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/argcomp/","publishdate":"2020-10-27T12:29:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/argcomp/","section":"publication","summary":"Online debates typically possess a large number of argumentative comments. Most readers who would like to see which comments are winning arguments often only read a part of the debate. Many platforms that host such debates allow for the comments to be sorted, say from the earliest to latest. How can argumentation theory be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such policies of sorting comments, in terms of the actually winning arguments displayed to a reader who may not have read the whole debate? We devise a pipeline that captures an online debate tree as a bipolar argumentation framework (BAF), which is sorted depending on the policy, giving a sequence of induced sub-BAFs representing how and how much of the debate has been read. Each sub-BAF has its own set of winning arguments, which can be quantitatively compared to the set of winning arguments of the whole BAF. We apply this pipeline to evaluate policies on Kialo debates, where it is shown that reading comments from most to least liked, on average, displays more winners than reading comments earliest first. Therefore, in Kialo, reading comments from most to least liked is on average more effective than reading from the earliest to the most recent.","tags":["Complex Networks","Machine Learning","Behaviour modelling","Argumentation"],"title":"Ranking comment sorting policies in online debates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aseniero, Bon Adriel","Marios Constantinides","**Sagar Joglekar**","Ke Zhou","Daniele Quercia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601119778,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608133387,"objectID":"aa72af0c883c28a8a59787935cf48861","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/iwwwvis_1/","publishdate":"2020-09-26T12:29:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/iwwwvis_1/","section":"publication","summary":"The remote work ecosystem is transforming patterns of communication between teams and individuals located at distance. Particularly, the absence of certain subtle cues in current communication tools may hinder an online's meeting outcome by negatively impacting attendees' overall experience and, often, make them feeling disconnected. The problem here might be due to the fact that current tools fall short in capturing it. To partly address this, we developed an online platform-MeetCues-with the aim of supporting online communication during meetings. MeetCues is a companion platform for a commercial communication tool with interactive and visual UI features that support back-channels of communications. It allows attendees to be more engaged during a meeting, and reflect in real-time or post-meeting. We evaluated our platform in a diverse set of five, real-world corporate meetings, and we found that, not only people were more engaged and aware during their meetings, but they also felt more connected.

The main problem is that these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around half a million Reddit posts in the sub-communities specialised in 14 medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep-learning framework. In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable to the use of social media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations.","tags":["Complex Networks","Machine Learning","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Humane Visual AI: Telling the Stories Behind a Medical Condition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Sagar Joglekar**","Sumithra Velupillai","Rina Dutta","Nishanth Sastry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595344755,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596215038,"objectID":"787a60fca81f21d61335f906fcbef630","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/triads/","publishdate":"2020-07-21T16:19:15+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/triads/","section":"publication","summary":"Platforms like Reddit and Twitter offer internet users an opportunity to talk about diverse issues, including those pertaining to physical and mental health. Some of these forums also function as a safe space for severely distressed mental health patients to get social support from peers. The online community platform Reddit's SuicideWatch is one example of an online forum dedicated specifically to people who suffer from suicidal thoughts, or who are concerned about people who might be at risk. It remains to be seen if these forums can be used to understand and model the nature of online social support, not least because of the noisy and informal nature of conversations. Moreover, understanding how a community of volunteering peers react to calls for help in cases of suicidal posts, would help to devise better tools for online mitigation of such episodes. In this paper, we propose an approach to characterise conversations in online forums. Using data from the SuicideWatch subreddit as a case study, we propose metrics at a macroscopic level -- measuring the structure of the entire conversation as a whole. We also develop a framework to measure structures in supportive conversations at a mesoscopic level -- measuring interactions with the immediate neighbours of the person in distress. We statistically show through comparison with baseline conversations from random Reddit threads that certain macro and meso-scale structures in an online conversation exhibit signatures of social support, and are particularly over-expressed in SuicideWatch conversations.","tags":["Social Networks","Complex Networks","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Analysing Meso and Macro conversation structures in an online suicide support forum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boschi, G.","Young, A.P.","**Sagar Joglekar**","Chiara Cammarota","Sastry, N."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590578978,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633215052,"objectID":"71409b242e4d42f8b38003f94b8f67b9","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/tweb/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T12:29:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tweb/","section":"publication","summary":"In online debates, as in offline ones, individual utterances or arguments support or attack each other, leading to some subset of arguments (potentially from different sides of the debate) being considered more relevant than others. However, online conversations are much larger in scale than offline ones, with often hundreds of thousands of users weighing in, collaboratively forming large trees of comments by starting from an original post and replying to each other. In large discussions, readers are often forced to sample a subset of the arguments being put forth. Since such sampling is rarely done in a principled manner, users may not read all the relevant arguments to get a full picture of the debate from a sample. This article is interested in answering the question of how users should sample online conversations to selectively favour the currently justified or accepted positions in the debate. We apply techniques from argumentation theory and complex networks to build a model that predicts the probabilities of the normatively justified arguments given their location in idealised online discussions of comments and replies, which we represent as trees. Our model shows that the proportion of replies that are supportive, the distribution of the number of replies that comments receive, and the locations of comments that do not receive replies (i.e., the ‚Äúleaves‚Äù of the reply tree) all determine the probability that a comment is a justified argument given its location. We show that when the distribution of the number of replies is homogeneous along the tree length, for acrimonious discussions (with more attacking comments than supportive ones), the distribution of justified arguments depends on the parity of the tree level, which is the distance from the root expressed as number of edges. In supportive discussions, which have more supportive comments than attacks, the probability of having justified comments increases as one moves away from the root. For discussion trees that have a non-homogeneous in-degree distribution, for supportive discussions we observe the same behaviour as before, while for acrimonious discussions we cannot observe the same parity-based distribution. This is verified with data obtained from the online debating platform Kialo. By predicting the locations of the justified arguments in reply trees, we can therefore suggest which arguments readers should sample, to grasp the currently accepted opinions in such discussions. Our models have important implications for the design of future online debating platforms.","tags":["Complex Networks","Machine Learning","Behaviour modelling","Argumentation"],"title":"Who Has the Last Word?

Most studies that look into disinformation, political influence and fake-news focus on mainstream social media platforms. This has inevitably made English an important factor in our current understanding of political activity on social media. As a result, there has only been a limited number of studies into a large portion of the world, including the largest, multilingual and multicultural democracy: India. In this paper we present our characterisation of a multilingual social network in India called ShareChat. We collect an exhaustive dataset across 72 weeks before and during the Indian general elections of 2019, across 14 languages. We investigate the cross lingual dynamics by clustering visually similar images together, and exploring how they move across language barriers. We find that Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada languages tend to be dominant in soliciting political images (often referred to as memes), and posts from Hindi have the largest cross-lingual diffusion across ShareChat (as well as images containing text in English). In the case of images containing text that cross language barriers, we see that language translation is used to widen the accessibility. That said, we find cases where the same image is associated with very different text (and therefore meanings). This initial characterisation paves the way for more advanced pipelines to understand the dynamics of fake and political content in a multi-lingual and non-textual setting.","tags":["Social Networks","Complex Networks","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Characterising User Content on a Multi-lingual Social Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Super excited to see that our paper on measuring differential behaviour of ad-tracking ecosystem towards the consumers of hyper-partisan websites was covered by the Wired news.\nIn this paper, we simulated behaviours of users belonging to particular partisan and demographic classes, and observed how the online advertisement machinenary tracks them as they visit well known partisan news websites.

Such content often polarizes users, who are repeatedly primed to specific (extreme) content, usually reflecting hard party lines on political and socio-economic topics. Though this polarization has been extensively studied with respect to content, it is still unknown how it associates with the online tracking experienced by browsing users, especially when they exhibit certain demographic characteristics. For example, it is unclear how such websites enable the ad-ecosystem to track users based on their gender or age. In this paper, we take a first step to shed light and measure such potential differences in tracking imposed on users when visiting specific party-line's websites. For this, we design and deploy a methodology to systematically probe such websites and measure differences in user tracking. This methodology allows us to create user personas with specific attributes like gender and age and automate their browsing behavior in a consistent and repeatable manner. Thus, we systematically study how personas are being tracked by these websites and their third parties, especially if they exhibit particular demographic properties. Overall, we test 9 personas on 556 hyper-partisan websites and find that right-leaning websites tend to track users more intensely than left-leaning, depending on user demographics, using both cookies and cookie synchronization methods and leading to more costly delivered ads.","tags":["Complex Networks","Machine Learning","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Stop Tracking Me Bro!

Unfortunately, deep learning techniques have notbeen designed with that challenge in mind.

We find that,across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes meet theexpectations set by the literature on what great spaces tendto be made of.

From the survey results, we derive general design guidelines on how information visualization makes complex machine-learning algorithms more understandable to a general audience.","tags":["Deep learning","Data Visualization","Urban Informatics"],"title":"Mapping and Visualizing Deep-Learning Urban Beautification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"We have receieved the Nvidia GPU seed grant, which I wrote on my Lab's behalf.

We examine a large, professionally curated list of 668hyper-partisan websites and their corresponding Facebook pages,and identify key characteristics that mediate the traffic flow withinthis ecosystem. We uncover a pattern of new websites being es-tablished in the run up to the elections, and abandoned after. Suchwebsites form an ecosystem, creating links from one website to an-other, and by ‚Äòliking‚Äô each others‚Äô Facebook pages. These practicesare highly effective in directing user traffic internally within theecosystem in a highly partisan manner, with right-leaning sites link-ing to and liking other right-leaning sites and similarly left-leaningsites linking to other sites on the left, thus forming a filter bubbleamongst newsproducerssimilar to the filter bubble which has beenwidely observed amongconsumersof partisan news. Whereas thereis activity along both left- and right-leaning sites, right-leaningsites are more evolved, accounting for a disproportionate numberof abandoned websites and partisan internal links. We also examinedemographic characteristics of consumers of hyper-partisan newsand find that some of the more populous demographic groups inthe US tend to be consumers of more right-leaning sites.","tags":["Complex Networks"],"title":"Illuminating an ecosystem of partisan websites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Sagar Joglekar**","Miriam Redi","Nishnath Sastry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506757458,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581165755,"objectID":"2698cb6ee3839e73ffc767869dbd5920","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/publication/socinfo17/","publishdate":"2017-09-30T08:44:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/socinfo17/","section":"publication","summary":"Several content-driven platforms have adopted the ‚Äòmicro video‚Äô for-mat, a new form of short video that is constrained in duration, typically at most5-10 seconds long. Micro videos are typically viewed through mobile apps, andare presented to viewers as a long list of videos that can be scrolled through.How should micro video creators capture viewers‚Äô attention in the short attentionspan? Does quality of content matter? Or do social effects predominate, givingcontent from users with large numbers of followers a greater chance of becomingpopular? To the extent that quality matters, what aspect of the video ‚Äì aestheticsor affect ‚Äì is critical to ensuring user engagement?We examine these questions using a snapshot of nearly all (120,000) videosuploaded to globally accessible channels on the micro video platform Vine overan 8 week period. We find that although social factors do affect engagement, con-tent quality becomes equally important at the top end of the engagement scale.Furthermore, using the temporal aspects of video, we verify that decisions aremade quickly, and that first impressions matter more, with the first seconds of thevideo typically being of higher quality and having a large effect on overall userengagement. We verify these data-driven insights with a user study from 115 re-spondents, confirming that users tend to engage with micro videos based on ‚Äúfirstsight‚Äù, and that users see this format as a more immediate and less professionalmedium than traditional user-generated video (e.g., YouTube) or user-generatedimages (e.g., Flickr).","tags":["Deep learning","Social Networks","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Like at First Sight: Understanding User Engagement with the World of Microvideos","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505321153,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579123750,"objectID":"a1eda53eb97e35604bf8ff0bd10c7c17","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/talk/socinfo2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-13T16:45:53Z","relpermalink":"/talk/socinfo2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"SocInfo2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Our work done on ecosystem of hyper partisan news sources has been covered by Buzzfeed news.

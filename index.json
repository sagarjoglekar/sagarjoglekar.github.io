Such content often polarizes users, who are repeatedly primed to specific (extreme) content, usually reflecting hard party lines on political and socio-economic topics. Though this polarization has been extensively studied with respect to content, it is still unknown how it associates with the online tracking experienced by browsing users, especially when they exhibit certain demographic characteristics. For example, it is unclear how such websites enable the ad-ecosystem to track users based on their gender or age. In this paper, we take a first step to shed light and measure such potential differences in tracking imposed on users when visiting specific party-line's websites. For this, we design and deploy a methodology to systematically probe such websites and measure differences in user tracking. This methodology allows us to create user personas with specific attributes like gender and age and automate their browsing behavior in a consistent and repeatable manner. Thus, we systematically study how personas are being tracked by these websites and their third parties, especially if they exhibit particular demographic properties. Overall, we test 9 personas on 556 hyper-partisan websites and find that right-leaning websites tend to track users more intensely than left-leaning, depending on user demographics, using both cookies and cookie synchronization methods and leading to more costly delivered ads.","tags":["Complex Networks","Machine Learning","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Stop Tracking Me Bro!

Yet they fall short when itcomes to generating actionable insights for urban design. Tosupport  urban  interventions,  one  needs  to  go  beyondpredictingbeauty,  and  tackle  the  challenge  ofrecreatingbeauty. Unfortunately, deep learning techniques have notbeen designed with that challenge in mind. Given their‘black-box nature’, these models cannot be directly used toexplain why a particular urban scene is deemed to bebeautiful. To partly fix that, we propose a deep learningframework (which we name FaceLift1) that is able to bothbeautifyexisting urban scenes (Google Street Views) andexplainwhich urban elements make those transformed scenesbeautiful.  To  quantitatively  evaluate  our  framework,  wecannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problemat hand has never been tackled before) and need to formulatenew ones. These new metrics should ideally capture thepresence (or absence) of elements that make urban spacesgreat. Upon a review of the urban planning literature, weidentifyfivemain  metrics:  walkability,  green  spaces,openness, landmarks and visual complexity. We find that,across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes meet theexpectations set by the literature on what great spaces tendto be made of. This result is further confirmed by a 20-participant expert survey in which FaceLift has been foundto be effective in promoting citizen participation. All thissuggests that, in the future, as our framework’s componentsare  further  researched  and  become  better  and  moresophisticated, it is not hard to imagine technologies that willbe able to accurately and efficiently support architects andplanners in the design of the spaces we intuitively love.","tags":["Deep learning","Data Visualization","Urban Informatics"],"title":"FaceLift: a transparent deep learning framework to beautify urban scenes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I succesfully defended my Ph.D titled \u0026ldquo;From Communities to Crowds: Quantifying the subjective\u0026rdquo;.

We uncover a pattern of new websites being es-tablished in the run up to the elections, and abandoned after. Suchwebsites form an ecosystem, creating links from one website to an-other, and by ‘liking’ each others’ Facebook pages. These practicesare highly effective in directing user traffic internally within theecosystem in a highly partisan manner, with right-leaning sites link-ing to and liking other right-leaning sites and similarly left-leaningsites linking to other sites on the left, thus forming a filter bubbleamongst newsproducerssimilar to the filter bubble which has beenwidely observed amongconsumersof partisan news. Whereas thereis activity along both left- and right-leaning sites, right-leaningsites are more evolved, accounting for a disproportionate numberof abandoned websites and partisan internal links.

Micro videos are typically viewed through mobile apps, andare presented to viewers as a long list of videos that can be scrolled through.How should micro video creators capture viewers’ attention in the short attentionspan? Does quality of content matter? Or do social effects predominate, givingcontent from users with large numbers of followers a greater chance of becomingpopular? To the extent that quality matters, what aspect of the video – aestheticsor affect – is critical to ensuring user engagement?We examine these questions using a snapshot of nearly all (120,000) videosuploaded to globally accessible channels on the micro video platform Vine overan 8 week period. We find that although social factors do affect engagement, con-tent quality becomes equally important at the top end of the engagement scale.Furthermore, using the temporal aspects of video, we verify that decisions aremade quickly, and that first impressions matter more, with the first seconds of thevideo typically being of higher quality and having a large effect on overall userengagement. We verify these data-driven insights with a user study from 115 re-spondents, confirming that users tend to engage with micro videos based on “firstsight”, and that users see this format as a more immediate and less professionalmedium than traditional user-generated video (e.g., YouTube) or user-generatedimages (e.g., Flickr).","tags":["Deep learning","Social Networks","Behaviour modelling"],"title":"Like at First Sight: Understanding User Engagement with the World of Microvideos","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505321153,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579123750,"objectID":"a1eda53eb97e35604bf8ff0bd10c7c17","permalink":"https://sagarjoglekar.com/talk/socinfo2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-13T16:45:53Z","relpermalink":"/talk/socinfo2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"SocInfo2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Our work done on ecosystem of hyper partisan news sources has been covered by Buzzfeed news.
